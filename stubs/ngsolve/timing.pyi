class Timing:
    """
    
    Class for timing analysis of performance critical functions. Some 
    classes export a C++ function as __timing__, which returns a map 
    of performance critical parts with their timings. The class can save 
    these maps, load them and compare them. It can be saved as a benchmark 
    to be compared against.
    
    2 overloaded __init__ functions:
    
    1. __init__(name,obj,parallel=True,serial=True)
    2. __init__(filename)
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    
    name (str): Name for the timed class (for output formatting and 
        saving/loading of results)
    obj (NGSolve object): Some NGSolve class which has the __timing__ 
        functionality implemented. Currently supported classes:
            FESpace
    filename (str): Filename to load a previously saved Timing
    parallel (bool=True): Time in parallel (using TaskManager)
    serial (bool=True): Time not in parallel (not using TaskManager)
